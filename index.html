    <p>A <strong>blockchain</strong> is a <span style="color: rgb(77, 77, 228);">distributed ledger</span> with growing lists of <span style="color: rgb(77, 77, 228);">records</span> <i>(blocks)</i> that are securely linked together via <span style="color: rgb(77, 77, 228);">cryptographic hashes.<sup>[1][2][3][4]</sup></span> Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a <span style="color: rgb(77, 77, 228);">timestamp,</span> and transaction data (generally represented as a <span style="color: rgb(77, 77, 228);">Merkle tree,</span> where<span style="color: rgb(77, 77, 228);"> data nodes</span> are represented by leaves). Since each block contains information about the previous block, they effectively form a chain (compare <span style="color: rgb(77, 77, 228);">linked list</span>  data structure), with each additional block linking to the ones before it. Consequently, blockchain transactions are irreversible in that, once they are recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks.</p>

    <p>Cryptographer <span style="color: rgb(77, 77, 228);">David Chaum </span> first proposed a blockchain-like protocol in his 1982 dissertation "Computer Systems Established, Maintained, and Trusted by Mutually Suspicious Groups."<span style="color: rgb(77, 77, 228);"><sup>[10]</sup></span> Further work on a cryptographically secured chain of blocks was described in 1991 by <span style="color: rgb(77, 77, 228);">Stuart Haber</span> and <span style="color: rgb(77, 77, 228);">W. Scott Stornetta.<sup>[4][11]</sup></span>  They wanted to implement a system wherein document <span style="color: rgb(77, 77, 228);">timestamps</span>  could not be tampered with. In 1992, Haber, Stornetta, and <span style="color: rgb(77, 77, 228);">Dave Bayer</span> incorporated <span style="color: rgb(77, 77, 228);">Merkle trees</span> into the design, which improved its efficiency by allowing several document certificates to be collected into one block.<span style="color: rgb(77, 77, 228);"><sup>[4][12] </sup></span>Under their company Surety, their document certificate hashes have been published in The <span style="color: rgb(77, 77, 228);"><em>New York Times</em></span>  every week since 1995.<span style="color: rgb(77, 77, 228);"><sup>[13]</sup></span></p><br>
    <p>The first decentralized blockchain was conceptualized by a person (or group of people) known as <span style="color: rgb(77, 77, 228);">Satoshi Nakamoto</span>  in 2008. Nakamoto improved the design in an important way using a <span style="color: rgb(77, 77, 228);">Hashcash</span>-like method to <span style="color: rgb(77, 77, 228);">timestamp</span> blocks without requiring them to be signed by a trusted party and introducing a difficulty parameter to stabilize the rate at which blocks are added to the chain.<span style="color: rgb(77, 77, 228);"><sup></sup>[4] </span>The design was implemented the following year by Nakamoto as a core component of the <span style="color: rgb(77, 77, 228);">cryptocurrency bitcoin,</span> where it serves as the public ledger for all transactions on the network.<span style="color: rgb(77, 77, 228);"><sup>[3]</sup></span></p>
